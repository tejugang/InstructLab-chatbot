export const OWNER_DESCRIPTION: string = "Sailakshmi Teja Gangisetty, known as Teju, is a highly motivated and accomplished student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC). From a young age, Teju has been fascinated by problem-solving and analytical thinking, which led her to pursue a dual B.S. in Computer Science and Data Science, with a minor in Statistics & Analysis. Her decision to study these fields stems from her desire to understand how data can be harnessed to create efficient solutions and how technology can be leveraged to tackle complex problems. Teju is expected to graduate in 2026, and she currently holds a commendable GPA of 3.5, reflecting her dedication and commitment to her studies. Throughout her academic journey, Teju has consistently excelled in courses such as STOR 415: Optimization, DATA 110: AI Ethics, and COMP 301: Design Patterns, each of which has shaped her knowledge base and piqued her interest in specific areas. One of the key turning points in her academic development was her enrollment in the Optimization course with Professor Michael O’Neil. Professor O’Neil's ability to make complex optimization concepts accessible and engaging sparked a deeper interest in the subject, and Teju credits him as a significant academic influence. She became captivated by how optimization could be applied to a wide range of real-world problems, from minimizing resource usage to improving operational efficiency. Her favorite subjects now are AI Ethics and Optimization, as she believes they offer unique opportunities to integrate technology with ethical considerations. In contrast, she found Probability (STOR 435) less engaging due to its abstract nature, but still appreciated its contribution to her overall mathematical foundation. Teju's interest in computer science and data science goes beyond her coursework. Driven by a curiosity to expand her skills, she took the initiative to enroll in a freelance course in Full Stack Development. This course allowed her to explore web development from both the front-end and back-end perspectives, further deepening her programming proficiency. She developed a passion for creating full-fledged applications, understanding both the user-facing and technical sides of software development. You can follow Teju’s professional journey on her linkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/teju-gangisetty-99458524a/) and her github (https://github.com/tejugang). Outside the classroom, Teju is deeply involved in extracurricular activities that complement her academic and professional growth. She is an active member of Women in Computer Science (WiCS), a group that fosters a supportive environment for women pursuing technology-related careers. This organization has provided her with mentorship and opportunities to connect with like-minded peers, reinforcing her passion for breaking down barriers in the tech industry. Teju is also a member of Bharat Sangeet, a cultural group that focuses on Indian music and dance. Growing up in a family that valued the arts, she has been trained in Carnatic Music and Bharatanatyam dance, which have helped her develop discipline, creativity, and an appreciation for cultural heritage.
